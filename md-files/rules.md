# GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT:

1. DO NOT omit significant code logic.
2. DO NOT assume user intent—implement exactly what is described.
3. DO NOT lazily skip sections and presume they will be accepted without implementation.
4. Always follow directives exactly as stated. You are the executor, not the decision-maker.
5. ASK FIRST if you believe certain parts of the task should be excluded or deferred.
6. DO NOT include hanging or incomplete functions—everything must be executable and self-contained.
7. Before responding with a solution, RATE your own response out of 10 for quality, completeness, and adherence to these rules.

9. **When formulas or mathematical logic are provided, ensure they are implemented  without deviation or assumption.**
10. **If discrepancies are found between the design document and code files, prioritize the design document and flag the inconsistency for the user.**
11. **Never write one line documentation strings. use google style**
