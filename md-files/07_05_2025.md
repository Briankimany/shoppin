## ✅ Overview

The refactor introduces foundational improvements across several dimensions:

* Unified DB session management (`session_scope`)
* Full redesign of product pricing and commission systems
* Expanded vendor plan architecture
* Order and payment systems modernization
* Improvements in frontend structure and integration

---

## 🔧 1. Session and Transaction Management (Backend)

### Centralized `session_scope`

* Introduced in `scoped_session.py`
* Applied to:

  * `OrderManager`
  * `VendorObj`
  * `PaymentManager`
  * `ClientAccessManager`
  * `SessionManager`
* Ensures:

  * Rollback on exceptions
  * Cleaner, consistent transactional boundaries

**Example**:

```python
with session_scope(func=OrderManager.create_new_order) as db_session:
    ...
```

## 📦 2. Order and Payment Logic Refactor

### `OrderManager`

* Class-based approach replacing static functions
* Key additions:

  * `get_order_by`, `get_order_by_session_tkn`
  * `create_new_order` (with item deduplication)
  * `update_stock_after_order` using scoped session
* Vendor order creation moved to `group_orders_to_vendors`

### `PaymentManager`

* Added `record_payments_batch`
* Refactored payment polling with `perf_counter`
* Integrated scoped sessions for all writes

---

## 💸 3. Charges, Commission, and Pricing System

### New Models:

* `Charge`, `ProductCharge`, `VendorCharge`
* `Discount`

### Product Enhancements:

* New hybrid properties:

  * `final_price`, `commission`, `total_commission`, `vendor_commission`
* Relationships:

  * `charge`, `vendor_cover`, `attributes`, `discount`

### Commission Logic:

* `VendorPlan.product_commission()` decides fee based on threshold logic
* Vendor fallback to `CustomVendorPlan` if present

---

## 🛍️ 4. Vendor Plan System Overhaul

### `VendorPlan`

* Now includes:

  * Product commission structure (flat/percent)
  * Scheduled/unscheduled withdrawal logic
  * Min payout threshold
  * Enum `PayoutFrequency`

### `CustomVendorPlan`

* Overrides `VendorPlan` if present

### `PlanFeature`

* Can be attached to both system and custom plans

---

## 👥 5. Model-Level Enhancements

### `UserProfile`

* Now relates to:

  * `UserBalance`
  * `ClearanceLevel`

### `Vendor`

* Computed fallback to `custom_plan` or `plan`
* `products` relationship refactored

### `Order`

* Replaced `payment_type` column with hybrid property (default: "M-pesa")

---

## 📊 6. Product Filtering and Query Utilities

### Utility Class Added

* `ProductQueryUtils` (refactored from functional code)
* Supports:

  * Attribute filtering
  * Pagination
  * Query profiling

---

## 🧪 7. Testing & Seeding Support

### `order_creators.py`

* Updated simulation logic to use new `OrderManager` flow
* Refactored how stock is updated and vendors divided

---

## 🧱 8. Database Schema and Table Relationships

* New association tables for:

  * Product → Attribute
  * Product → AttributeValue
* `Base` extended via `TimeStampedBase`

---

## 🌐 9. Frontend / Routes / UI Logic

### Blueprint Registration

* Registered new blueprint in `main.py`:

  ```python
  from app.routes.products_route import blueprint
  app.register_blueprint(blueprint)
  ```

### Route Changes:

* `/info/<file>` added to dynamically serve info pages
* `inject_user_data()` expanded:

  * Sets `enable_search` if path contains 'test'
  * Injects user/vendor session safely

### Logger and Middleware

* Logging system extended:

  * `DB`, `SHOP`, and `ORDER` loggers more consistently used

### Templates:

* Vendor info page routing added

  * e.g., `info/vendor/<file>.html`

---

## 🧩 10. Miscellaneous

### `.gitignore`

* Added:

  * `*.log`, `notebooks/`, `*.Identifier`

### Model Refactors

* Converted enums to Python `Enum` + SQLAlchemy `Enum`
* Introduced `ObfuscateId` for ID obfuscation using `hashids`

---

## ✅ Summary

This refactor lays a scalable, modular backend for an e-commerce platform with the following improvements:

* DRY, robust DB session management

* Dynamic product pricing
* Improved order and payment processing
* Cleaner UI integration and markdown-driven info routes
