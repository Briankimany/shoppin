### âœ… Summary of Changes

- [x] **Improved `.gitignore`**
  - Now ignores only `migrations/versions/` instead of all of `migrations`.

- [x] **Centralized model imports**
  - Created a comprehensive `__init__.py` file in `app.models` for wildcard model imports.

- [x] **Updated user model**
  - Added relationships: `vendor` (one-to-one) and `clearance` (many-to-many).
  - Added `is_admin` and `is_staff` computed properties.
  - [x]Clearance levels 
    ```python
    {
        1: "Admin",
        2: "Maintainer" # vendor/Customer support 
        3: "Vendor" # the one selling products
        4: "Client"# the normal user
    }
    ```

- [x] **Refactored vendor model**
  - Removed redundant fields (`name`, `email`, `phone`).
  - These are now accessed via `@hybrid_property` from the related `UserProfile`.

- [x] **Updated session update logic**
  - Wrapped `update_session_value` in `session_scope` context manager for transaction safety.

- [x] **Removed obsolete file**
  - Deleted `app/modify_database.py`.

- [x] **Added utility endpoints**
  - New routes for shipping, cookies, returns, index, and FAQ pages.

- [x] **Extended IP tracking**
  - Implemented `get_ip_data` scraper from `whatismyipaddress.com`.
  - Enhanced `log_geo_data` for detailed IP + user-agent logging.

- [x] **Enhanced user profile route**
  - Uses updated `user_obj` pattern for rendering profile data safely.

- [x] **Updated vendor login flow**
  - Now redirects to unified user login route.

- [x] **Reworked CSS for vendor landing**
  - Massive overhaul of `home.css` for professional styling and responsiveness.

- [x] **Created `seeds/` directory** for database initialization.
- [x] **Added `seeds/vendor_data.py`**
  - Includes refactored `users_data` and `vendors_data` split.
  - Uses `get_image(vendor_key)` to avoid duplication of logo URLs.
- [x] **Populated vendor data with first and second names** (e.g., `first_name="Liam"`, `second_name="Mwangi"`).
- [x] **Updated payment type values** in vendor seed data to `"post"`/`"pre"` to match delivery logic, not processors like Stripe or PayPal.
